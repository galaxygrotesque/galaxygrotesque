My name is Cade, and I’m a writer of over 15 years with a professional background in software quality assurance. I specialise in clean, simple documentation that is both easy to read and easy on the eyes.

## What I do

**Solve problems.** A document is a solution to a problem. That problem can be as simple as “What is the correct procedure for receiving inventory?” or as complex as “Help, all of our documentation is obsolete” — or anything beyond and in between!

I plan, draft, and create the best solution for the problem at my feet.

To achieve this, I focus on three components:

- **Readability** --- Plain language, audience-appropriate tone and content
- **Visibility** --- White space, formatting, graphic imagery, typography
- **Usability** --- Content organisation, accessibility, ease of use

Each is important when it comes to writing or publishing, but when pieced together, they make a better document — and a better solution.

## What I bring

**Clarity.** The best documentation uses clear, compelling language. If a document isn’t easy to read or understand, it defeats its own purpose. I apply clarity and simplicity to meet the audience’s needs.

**Consistency.** Whether you’re learning a new skill or developing a new habit, consistency is key. I emphasise consistency in language, layout, and style; it is my foundation for writing and design.

**User centricity.** Technical writing and QA often intertwine in the software world. While they share many common threads, the thread most vital is user experience. Writers and developers occasionally lose sight of this fact, resulting in products that miss the point — the point that the user is, arguably, the most important stakeholder in any project.
