Work instructions provide step-by-step explanations on how to carry out work tasks. They are essential training material for new employees and should be drafted with detail and clarity in mind.

## Context

As part of the knowledge transfer process, I drafted new work instructions to help onboard new QA employees. This document was a quick project meant to satisfy the need for work instructions in the interim as the company sought to make significant changes to its technology stack within the coming months.

The previous work instructions were obsolete and my timeframe was limited, so I started from scratch. I loosely followed the previous work instructions’ layout using the document style I developed throughout [my work on the company’s SOW](/portfolio/sow). Since I was a QA employee, writing the content itself was less challenging than deciding how to break it down and present it to an unfamiliar audience. I borrowed ideas from guides and other technical writing documents I found whilst researching, namely unique boxes for examples/code and a section devoted to terms and acronyms.

I achieved my main objective — document our QA process for newcomers — but if I’d had more time, I would have added screenshots to help with ESL comprehension. Visuals would have cut down on example boxes, added more context, and given the content more space on the page.
