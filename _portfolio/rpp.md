It’s good practice to add a README file when publishing a repository. README files typically include information about what the project does, why it might be useful, and how users can get started. A README file is often a user’s first impression of a project.

## Context

ReversiPlusPlus (RPP) was the first repository I published on GitHub. It was my first attempt at writing CSS that was not strictly for personal use. It was also my first time writing documentation with a [“docs as code” approach](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/){:target="_blank"}; I was familiar with Markdown but I hadn’t used VS Code or Notepad++ to write it — only iA Writer.

Using other READMEs as a guide, I outlined the major sections and filled them in. Many GitHub projects had [social previews](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/customizing-your-repositorys-social-media-preview){:target="_blank"}, so I picked up Figma and designed my own. The most difficult hurdle I encountered was acquiring appropriate screenshots for previews and comparisons. Since I was already using Firefox’s web developer kit to code, I grabbed HTML from the Inspector tool, defined my own dummy data work blurbs, and inserted them into the web page for capturing.

Like RPP itself, RPP’s README is a work-in-progress and has evolved extensively over the course of the project. I plan to adjust the tone and add more sections as I work on organising and refining the project’s code in my spare time.
