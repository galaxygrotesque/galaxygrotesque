A statement of work (SOW) is one of the most important customer-facing documents. It defines the scope and deliverables of a project, but it is also a visual representation the company and its work.

## Context

My task was to overhaul my employerâ€™s SOW template. Its content was outdated functionally and visually. It had been in use for about 10 years without significant revisions, and every customer, new and existing, received an SOW derived from that template.

I began by developing a more modern style I could standardise. I chose new typefaces, defined a new colour palette, adjusted the page layout, and added more white space. After that, the bulk of the work was formatting and proofreading. I added appendices, fixed typos, revised unclear sentences, updated flowcharts, rearranged multiple sections, and removed anything considered obsolete.

At the time, this was my most challenging project due to its size and importance. I frequently searched for layout and organisation ideas online and tried them to see what made sense. Feedback from the development and support teams was invaluable throughout this process, and I made regular adjustments at their request.
