## Who am I?

I‚Äôm a tenacious nerd with a taste for challenge.

I need something for my brain to chew on, something to make me think and grow. I believe stagnation is antithetical to who we are as people, so growth and improvement are fiercely important to me. I enjoy learning new things, solving new problems, and finding new ways to do things better.

Life has taught me that change is constant, inevitable, and, more often than not, uncomfortable. If we want to weather it and weather it well, we need to put our best foot forward and start walking.

## On writing and editing

I have a deep love of language, [typography](https://practicaltypography.com/){:target="_blank"}, and the written word. The act of shaping thought into paragraph has delighted me since childhood; I see beauty in white space and word choice and the rhythm of syllable and syntax.

I love styling documents, cleaning up old work, and fixing errors through proofreading. I also appreciate a good nonbreaking space. All punctuation is great, but [em dashes](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/why-you-should-love-the-em-dash/){:target="_blank"} and the [Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma){:target="_blank"} hold a special place in my heart. ü©µ

## Tidbits

- Given sufficient references, I can emulate other writing styles regardless of grammar or isolect. I‚Äôm a bona fide chameleon! ü¶é‚ôæÔ∏è
- My casual communications are a mishmash of British English and Canadian English for the flavour (preserve the U!), but I grew up with American English and can use any of the aforementioned varieties as needed.
- I‚Äôm a self-taught writer! Aside from the typical English classes one takes throughout school, that is.
